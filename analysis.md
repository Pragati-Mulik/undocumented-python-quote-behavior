# üß† Analysis: Python Quote Parsing Behavior

Python accepts both single (`'`) and double (`"`) quotes to define strings. When using 1 to 3 quotes, the behavior is well-understood and documented. But when using 4, 5, or 6 quotes to surround a string, Python can:
- Accept it silently (valid, but unexpected)
- Produce malformed strings (e.g., leftover quote characters)
- Raise syntax errors (parser cannot interpret correctly)

---

## üîç Observations

- Triple quotes work as expected: \`\`\`hi\`\`\` and \"\"\"hi\"\"\" both return `hi`
- Adding one or more quotes beyond the triple may introduce *extra quote characters* inside the string
- Uneven opening/closing quotes frequently result in syntax errors

This behavior was discovered during a manual test across 36 patterns for each quote type.

## üéØ Educational and Research Use

- This is an ideal case for exploring how language tokenizers work
- Can enhance understanding of ambiguity in language grammars
- Potentially useful for static analysis, linter enhancement, or sandbox security audits

By presenting it openly, this project invites deeper research or even enhancement proposals to clarify, restrict, or document this part of Python‚Äôs behavior.
